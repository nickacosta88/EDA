# EDA
# The first thing I did was clean the raw data and eliminated the missing values within the dataset
# The next thing I did was perform a correlation analysis on the raw data
# I then split the dataset into a "train" and "test" groups
# I created a performance benchmark to see how the two new sets would perform
# Then the issues came in when I wanted to start moedling. I had a ton of errors that I ran into on my end and so I wasn't able to clean up my data in a better way to avoid these errors.
# My focus on the project was the correlation analysis and the performance benchmark which helped in discovering the accuracy of the majority class.
# The contribution I also made was with the business problem statement/challenge of the project in which we wanted to better identify the best customer segmentation for Home Credit to lower overall default profiles.
# The way we were able to do this was by focusing on key predictors that we felt would help us better assess risk. We were then able to find the performance of those predictors and utilize them to create a customer persona for Home Credit.
# The things we recommend doing with this project moving forward is to address the class imbalance issue which made the accuracy difficult for improving within each new model implementation.
# The other recommendation is to use feature engineering strategies to better the overall AUC of our model.
